# final-project

In this project, we created an illusion machine. This machine can choose from our three different auditory illusions: Shepard Tone, Risset Rhythm, and Mysterious Melodies.

In order to call Shepard Tone, you need to input a midi-note and duration along with n. The Shepard Tone will last for n amount of notes.

To call Mysterious Melodies, you only need to imput which melody you would like to be made mysterious. 

Lastly, in order to call jukebox or our illusion machine, you need to input the midi-note, dur, the string of which illusion, and the melody if you decide to do mysterious melodies (otherwise input 0). Do this by calling the jukebox-husk function, not jukebox.

To work the animations, simply rode the code and then click on the picture that appears. The animation won't run unless you keep clicking on them.

There are three seperate animations, the Risset Rythm animation is included, although we were unable to fully implement the illusion itself.
